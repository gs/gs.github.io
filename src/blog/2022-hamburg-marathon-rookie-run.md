<div class="lead">Wow, we have already 2023, I finally decided to write about my first ever marathon run, which happened on 24th of April 2022. I will do my best to describe how and why I decided to run it, and what was happening with me, physically and mentally, during those 5 hours.</div>

<p class="mt-3">Btw, I’m signed up for <a href="https://haspa-marathon-hamburg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next run</a> — join me!</p>

## Introduction
I'm in my 40s, good health, software engineer, usually sitting at work—active for fun (running, walking, biking). Ran 10km sometimes, never did marathon prep, never followed a plan or diet.

## 1 week before the marathon
April 17th, Hamburg. Saw a marathon poster—decided to run. Half marathon was booked, so I signed up for full.

## Preparation to run
I rested a week before (sore calf). No other prep, just nerves!

## Marathon day
Started in the last “K” block (estimate: 6h). Did quick math: “I’ll try for 5h!”

**My kit:** 1 protein bar, phone, 2 Hot Wheel cars from my kids.

</p>

## Start + 5—10—15km
Lots of cheering, crowded! I overtook people, picked somebody to follow, focused/locked in. Grabbed a banana and water for the first time while running.

## 17km — Snafu
Got hungry—my pocket snack was missing (still in my backpack). Mini panic and “mental dip”. Spotted my pace-runner, snapped out of it.

## 20–25km — Family, then letdown
Missed seeing my kids on the bridge. Second dip. Call with my wife: “see you at the finish line!”

## 28km — Struggling
Hit the wall. Stopped running, walked. Leg pain. Grit.

  <br><span style="color:#888;">Not fun anymore</span>
</p>

Still going, trying not to quit.

  <br><span style="color:#888;">I’m done! Walking mode.</span>
</p>

## 30–40km — Pain and Push
Grabbed bananas, gels, water at food stands. Tried short runs again. Sometimes pain was worse walking than running. Just moved forward, meter by meter.

  <br><span style="color:#888;">Head down. 1 meter more, just 1 meter more.</span>
</p>

## The finish (42,195m)
Saw the grandstand, finish line, finally waved at my family—hi-5s and tears. Crossed the line: 4h:53m!

</p>

## Reflections
Finishing was wild—never dreamed I could do it. “Average person, not athlete.” If you care, commit, and keep going, you’ll surprise yourself.
